# Stev232 Note Taker

## Description

The purpose of this web app is to take user notes and file them in a side menu showing the title of the note. The app is hosted on Heroku and utilizes node.js and express.js for the backend. It also utilizes json objects as its database. When a user saves their note it gets stored on the left hand side and the user will be able to see the title and an option to delete that note. If the user clicks on the note then the data entry area will be filled with that notes data. If the user clicks the + in the top right that data will be cleared out and the user will be able to enter data for a new note. Unfortunately I was not able to get the delete feature finished for the assignment turn in time.
